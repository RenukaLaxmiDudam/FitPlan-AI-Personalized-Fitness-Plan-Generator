# Milestone 1 – Front-End Development

## Objective
To develop a user-friendly fitness profile web application using Streamlit that collects user health details and calculates BMI before AI integration.

## BMI Formula
BMI = weight (kg) / (height in meters)^2

Height is converted from centimeters to meters before calculation.

## Steps Performed
1. Created user input form using Streamlit.
2. Added input validation (no empty name, no zero/negative values).
3. Converted height from cm to meters.
4. Calculated BMI.
5. Rounded BMI to 2 decimal places.
6. Classified BMI into:
   - Underweight
   - Normal
   - Overweight
   - Obese
7. Displayed user's name, BMI value, and category.
8. Deployed application on Hugging Face Spaces.
